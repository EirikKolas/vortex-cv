# Vortex-CV
A repository of a set of modules for computer vision used and developed by Vortex NTNU in their AUV and ASV software stacks. The modules are meant to be pipelined serially with the end goal of classifying objects and determining their poses (positions and according orientations) in 3D space. Having that in mind, the individual programs are also possible to be used independently to achieve singular goals.
